## Extract from zip/write to zip in Java

A project where I test extracting files from a zip and refining the result in various ways.
There is also an api for streaming a zip as an ouputstream, to avoid storing the file in memory and on disc.

The folder "exceptions" is inspired by Venkat Subramaniam's way of handling exceptions inside a stream.

### Requirements
Java 17 and Maven
